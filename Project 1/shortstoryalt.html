    <p>
      A king appointed the most handsome of all his soldiers as his bodyguard. One day he dispatched him to
      a rich
      nobleman, who made a point of protecting his wondrously beautiful daughter from soldiers by telling her:
      "Anna,don't exchange a single word with
      a soldier!" But this soiler happened to like the beautiful young woman, and Anna happened to like him as well.
      Before long, they were on intimate terms with each other, and the bodyguard asked the nobleman for his
      daughter's
      hand. The girls father was
      furious when he heard the request, for Anna was his only daughter, and the bodyguard was sure to be nothing but
      a
      fortune hunter.
    </p>

    <p> Some time passed, and Anna gave birth to a sweet little prince. The nobleman asked the guard: "if you reach the
      top of the mountain made of glass and steal three golden feathers from the tail of the dragon there, I will let
      you marry my daughter."</p>

    <p>the guard began the long march to the mountain. on his way he passed through a kingdom and had to report the
      purpose of his visit to the local ruler. When the king learned that the young man was on his way to the dragon, he
      told him to ask about the golden
      chain that he had lost some time ago. The soldier would not be able to travel through his kingdom unless he put
      that question to the dragon.</p>

    <p>A year later he was given a task by another king: "I have a fig tree that bears no fruit. Ask the dragon why!

    <p> Another year passed and he met two ferrymen, who wondered how long they would have to keep rowing across the
      river until the curse on them was listed.</p>

    <p>Finally the guard reached the glass mountain. Since the dragon was not home, the soldier told his story to the
      dragon's wife. She fidgeted and squirmed and then said: "I'm not allowed to let anyone in the house. When my
      husband returns, you won't be safe."
      The guard pleaded with her until finally she agreed to let him hide in a corner of the room. She brought him
      something to eat and he fell asleep. The dragon came home, ate and drank, and then he fell into a deep sleep.
      While he was snoring, his wife
      pulled a golden feather from his tail. He woke up and shouted:"why did you give me a shove?"</p>

    <p>"Oh," she replied, "I was just dreaming about a kind who lost a golden chain, and he wanted to know where it
      was."</p>

    <p> "it's at the bottom of a very dark dungeon. If it stays there for one more year, it will belong to me." He went
      back to sleep. His wife pulled out a second feather. "Why are you pinching me?"</p>

    <p>"I was dreaming about a fig tree that bears no fruit."</p>

    <p>"a forbidden fruit is buried beneath it." She pulled out a third feather and asked about the two ferrymen who
      were waiting to be liberated. The dragon was now infuriated, but told her: the next time they row someone across,
      they must shout, 'we are free'"</p>

    <p> The bodyguard traveled back home. When the two rowers saw him, they shouted over to him and asked if he found a
      solution. He told them to row him to the other side, and then he repeated what the dragon has said.</p>

    <p> Next came the king with the fig tree. The guard told him about the forbidden fruit under the tree and was
      rewarded with an army and lotf of money. A year later he reached the king who was looking for his lost chain. The
      king started digging in the right
      place, and there it was. At least the guard could ride back home</p>

    <p> The young man had been away for six years, and in the time the nobleman had gone broke and was now selling
      dishes. The guard wanted to get revenge, and he rode to the marketplace with his soldiers and ordered them to
      break all the dishes. The nobleman
      protested, and the guard threw some money at his feet: "Here you go, old man. Buy yourself some new dishes!" The
      next day, the guard had the dishes destroyed again. "Have you figured out who I am?" The nobleman did not
      recognize him until the guard
      showed him the three feathers taken from the dragon. The nobleman thanked him expressed his genuine remorse. Now
      he was finally willing to give the king's bodyguard the hand of his daughter in marriage. He himself received a
      good position at the court,
      and so they all lived happily ever after.</p>
